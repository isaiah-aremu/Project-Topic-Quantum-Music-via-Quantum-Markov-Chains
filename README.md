**Abstract**

This project examines the intersection of quantum computing and algorithmic music generation by utilizing quantum Markov processes. Building on the foundations of classical Markov chains and random walks, I implemented two quantum walk frameworks—the Coined Quantum Walk and the Szegedy Quantum Walk—on musical graphs that encode notes, durations, and intensities.

The study compares classical and quantum generative approaches, showing how quantum superposition and interference can enhance diversity in generated musical sequences. Using Python and Qiskit, I conducted numerical simulations to evaluate various quantum coin operators and demonstrated the adaptability of Szegedy walks to complex musical state spaces.

Although the work does not propose new algorithms, it consolidates key concepts and provides accessible models for generating music inspired by quantum principles. The results demonstrate how quantum walks can produce polytonal and rhythmically varied compositions, highlighting their potential as a novel approach to generative modeling. This project reflects my broader interest in data-driven modeling, probabilistic methods, and their applications at the intersection of machine learning, physics, and the creative arts.
